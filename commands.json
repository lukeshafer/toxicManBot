Official Minecraft Server!**\n\nServer Info:\n\n**Minecraft Java Edition (PC Only)**: \nServer Address: lukeandanahita.mynetgear.com:53940\n\n**Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Mobile, Console, \"Windows 10 Edition\"**\nServer Address: lukeandanahita.mynetgear.com\nPort: 53941\n***Note: If you're on console (Xbox/PS4/PS5/Switch) you may need to take extra steps to connect! Follow this link for instructions: https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Using-Geyser-with-Consoles\n\nOther notes:\n- Current in-game difficulty: Peaceful\n- We have a little town where all of our houses are, and a house where villagers live. Feel free to find some open space around there to build your house! \n- A lot of us have supplies that we'd love to share, so if you need anything, feel free to ask in game or in the Discord #games channel!\n- If you die, you respawn WITH your items! No need to stress!\n- Make sure to be respectful and not destroy things other players have built! \n- If you're having a tough time because of monsters, feel free to let us know (you can DM me or Anahita) and we can turn the difficulty down to Peaceful! We alternate between Peaceful and Easy regularly\n    - We will probably *not* turn the difficulty higher than Easy on request, as it's meant to be a pretty relaxed space! If you want a challenge, this is not the server for you!",
